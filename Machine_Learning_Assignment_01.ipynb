    "\n",
    "ANSWER- Machine Learning is the branch of AI(artificial intelligence) that allow software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicity programmed to do so.Overall machine learning enables computers to analyze complex data ,recognize patterns,and make predictions or decisions based on the patterns they have learned."
